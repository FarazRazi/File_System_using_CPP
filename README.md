# File_System_using_CPP
 This C++ code uses Filesystem library to implement an Nary tree.   
- The Nary tree is then used to represent the subdirectories in level order, in order, pre order and post order. 
- To read directries root address is provided using File system Funtion :
  `fs::recursive_directory_iterator(rootval)`
- Also the Quick Search algo is implemented, the files are saved in AVL tree on the base of first letter acordingly
## There is still a lot of work remaining
- The editing of files and folders (delete, add, merge)
- Only Functions are implemented main driver code remaining
